[{"slug":"/docs/reference-advanced","title":"Advanced Panel","breadcrumbs":"Reference / Advanced Panel","content":" Advanced Panel  The Advanced Panel is the heart of complex animations in VFX Studio. It allows you to chain multiple effects together, creating sophisticated sequences that go beyond simple emitters. It consists of three main modules: Tween Paths, Camera Shake, and Impact Frames.  Tween Paths  The Tween section lets you animate any Part, Model, or Attachment along a custom path. You can add multiple tween steps to create complex movement patterns.  Common Tween Properties  - **Count:** The number of objects to spawn and tween along the path(s). Only editable on the first step. - **Delay:** The time in seconds to wait before this tween step begins. - **Duration:** The time in seconds it takes to traverse the path for this step. - **Easing Style & Direction:** Controls the acceleration and deceleration of the object along the path. - **On Completion:** Trigger a Camera Shake or Impact Frame step after this tween completes.  Path Modes  Each tween step has a \"Path Mode\" that defines the shape of the movement.  - **Linear:** A straight line from the start to the target position. - **Arc:** A curved path towards the target. You can control its height, skew (where the peak of the arc is), and add 3D randomness. - **Randomized:** A jagged path made of multiple points. You control the number of points and the \"volatility\" (how far they can deviate from a straight line). - **Manual 3D:** A full 3D Bezier curve editor for complete control over complex paths. You can add, move, and delete control points directly in the 3D viewport.  Camera Shake  This module allows you to create and trigger powerful camera shake effects. You can add multiple shake steps to layer effects or trigger them at different times.  Shake Properties  - **Magnitude:** The overall intensity of the shake. - **Roughness:** How jagged and noisy the shake movement is. Higher values are more chaotic. - **FadeIn/FadeOut Time:** The duration in seconds for the shake to ramp up to full intensity and fade back to none. - **Position/Rotation Influence:** A Vector3 controlling how much the shake affects the camera's position versus its rotation on each axis. - **Delay:** Time in seconds to wait before this shake begins. - **Presets:** A dropdown of pre-configured shakes (e.g., Explosion, Impact, Rumble) to get you started quickly.  Impact Frames  Impact Frames are screen-space post-processing effects, ideal for emphasizing impacts, explosions, or magical moments. They apply a quick color transformation to the entire screen.  Impact Properties  - **Delay & Duration:** Control the timing of the effect. - **Saturation, Brightness, Contrast:** Adjust the color properties of the screen during the effect. Values can be negative. - **Tint Color:** Overlays a color on top of the screen for the duration of the effect."},{"slug":"/docs/reference-bezier","title":"Curve Editor","breadcrumbs":"Reference / Curve Editor","content":" Curve Editor  This is a placeholder for the **Curve Editor** documentation.
