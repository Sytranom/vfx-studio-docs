[{"slug":"/docs/reference-advanced","title":"Advanced Panel","breadcrumbs":"Reference / Advanced Panel","content":"This documentation is a workinprogress. The features and properties described below are for demonstration purposes and have been generated by AI. The Advanced Panel is the heart of complex animations in VFX Studio. It allows you to chain multiple effects together, creating sophisticated sequences that go beyond simple emitters. It consists of three main modules: Tween Paths, Camera Shake, and Impact Frames. Tween Paths The Tween section lets you animate any Part, Model, or Attachment along a custom path. You can add multiple tween steps to create complex movement patterns. lua filename=\"missile.lua\" This is a simplified runtime representation of a tween path local vfx = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.VFX) local missileEffect = vfx.GetEffect(\"Missile\") missileEffect:Emit({ Start = CFrame.new(0, 10, 0), Target = game.Workspace.Target.Position }) lua filename=\"multistagemissile.lua\" This demonstrates a path with multiple stages local vfx = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.VFX) local multiStageEffect = vfx.GetEffect(\"MultiStageMissile\") multiStageEffect:Emit({ Start = CFrame.new(0, 10, 0), Target = game.Workspace.Target.Position, Override properties at runtime Properties = { PathMode = \"Arc\", ArcHeight = 50 } }) Tween Properties The number of objects to spawn and tween along the path(s). This can only be edited on the first step of the sequence. The time in seconds it takes to traverse the path for this step. A lower value means faster movement. {/ THIS IS THE FIX: Add a paddingbottom class (pb4) to the wrapper div. This will create the necessary space between the bottom of the visualizer and the divider. /} Controls the acceleration and deceleration of the object along the path. Use the interactive visualizer below to explore the available options. Determines the smoothness of the path. High provides more anchor points for smoother curves but may cost more performance. Low is more optimized for simple paths. Automatic adjusts based on path complexity. Camera Shake This module allows you to create and trigger powerful camera shake effects. You can add multiple shake steps to layer effects or trigger them at different times. Camera Shake Properties The overall intensity of the shake. Higher values result in more violent camera movement. How jagged and noisy the shake movement is. Higher values are more chaotic and less smooth. If true, the shake effect will gradually reduce in intensity if it overlaps with another shake, preventing excessive screen judder. A Vector3 multiplier controlling how much the shake affects the camera's position on each axis. Impact Frames Impact Frames are screenspace postprocessing effects, ideal for emphasizing impacts or magical moments. Impact Frame Properties Overlays a color on top of the screen for the duration of the effect. The color space for the tint. Options are RGB for standard overlay or OKLCH for perceptually uniform color blending. Adjusts the color saturation of the screen during the effect. Values can be negative to desaturate the scene."},{"slug":"/docs/reference-bezier","title":"Curve Editor","breadcrumbs":"Reference / Curve Editor","content":"This documentation is a workinprogress. The features and properties described below are for demonstration purposes and have been generated by AI. The Curve Editor is your goto tool for creating fluid, naturallooking animations. Instead of static values, you can make properties like Size, Transparency, and Color change dynamically over the lifetime of an effect. It uses Bezier curves, which allow you to define a smooth path between two points using control handles. This gives you precise control over acceleration and deceleration, making your animations feel polished and professional. Core Concepts The editor is built around a few key ideas. Understanding these will help you master animation curves quickly. Control Points These are the main points on the graph that define the value of a property at a specific time. You can add a new point by Ctrl+Clicking on the graph canvas. Tangent Handles Each control point has two tangent handles that control the shape of the curve entering and leaving the point. Dragging these handles changes the easing of the animation. Graph Axes The horizontal axis (X) represents the normalized lifetime of the effect (from 0 to 1), and the vertical axis (Y) represents the property's value. Usage and Examples lua Curves can also be defined and applied at runtime. local vfx = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.VFX) local myEffect = vfx.GetEffect(\"MyCustomEffect\") Create a new curve that quickly fades in, then slowly fades out. local customAlphaCurve = vfx.Curve.new({ { time = 0, value = 0 }, { time = 0.2, value = 1, tangentIn = {0.1, 0.7}, tangentOut = {0.3, 1.0} }, { time = 1, value = 0 } }) myEffect:Emit({ Properties = { Transparency = customAlphaCurve } }) Add Point: Ctrl + Click anywhere on the graph. Delete Point: Select a point and press Delete. Break Tangents: Hold Alt while dragging a tangent handle to move it independently from the other. Snap to Grid: Hold Shift while dragging a point or tangent to snap it to the grid for precise values. Curve Properties These properties control the overall behavior of the curve itself. Controls the overall 'tightness' of the curve around its control points. Higher values create a more pronounced curve, while lower values result in a gentler slope. Determines how many segments are used to approximate the curve in the final effect. High is smoother for complex curves, Low is more performant for simple ones, and Automatic decides based on curve complexity. Defines the behavior when the animation timeline ends. Once: The animation plays a single time. Loop: The animation restarts from the beginning. PingPong: The animation plays forwards, then backwards, then forwards again."},{"slug":"/docs/reference-keybinds","title":"Keybinds & Shortcuts","breadcrumbs":"Reference / Keybinds","content":"This documentation is a workinprogress. The features and shortcuts listed below are for demonstration purposes and have been generated by AI. Boost your productivity and streamline your workflow by mastering the keyboard shortcuts in VFX Studio. These shortcuts are available globally while the VFX Studio window is focused. Ctrl + S: Save the currently selected effect. Ctrl + Z: Undo the last action. Ctrl + Y: Redo the last undone action. Ctrl + Shift + R: Resimulate the currently selected effect in the viewport, restarting its animation. Delete: Delete the selected emitter or module. Quickly navigate and toggle the different panels within the UI. F1: Toggle the Emitter Properties panel. F2: Toggle the Sliders panel. F3: Toggle the Curve Editor panel. F4: Toggle the Advanced Panel. Tab: Cycle focus between the currently open panels. Shortcuts for interacting with effects directly in the 3D viewport. F: Frame the selected effect, centering it in the camera's view. Alt + Left Click + Drag: Orbit the camera around the effect's origin. Alt + Right Click + Drag: Dolly (zoom) the camera in and out. Ctrl + Alt + Click: Select the emitter source of a particle you click on. All keybinds can be customized in the Settings panel.

The features and properties described below are for demonstration purposes and have been generated by AI. The Sliders Panel provides quick, realtime control over an emitter's most common properties. It's designed for rapid iteration and finetuning, allowing you to see the impact of your changes instantly without digging through menus. Any change made in the Sliders Panel is reflected instantly in the 3D viewport. This \"Live Sync\" feature is the core of the panel, enabling a fluid and intuitive workflow where you can adjust properties while the effect is playing. You can customize this panel to fit your needs! Rightclick any property in the main Emitter Panel and select \"Add to Sliders Panel\" to create a custom slider for quick access. This is perfect for properties you find yourself adjusting frequently. By default, the Sliders Panel includes a set of the most frequently used emitter properties. Controls the number of particles emitted per second. Increasing this value creates a denser effect. Determines how long each individual particle exists, in seconds. This property can also be a range (e.g., 1.5, 2.5) to add variation. Sets the initial velocity of emitted particles. Higher values will project particles further and faster from the emitter source. Defines the emission cone in degrees on the X and Y axes. A value of 360, 360, 0 creates a spherical emission pattern. A master scale multiplier that affects all sizerelated properties of the effect, including particle size, emitter shape, and tween paths. Useful for quickly resizing an entire effect."}]
