The Sliders Panel provides quick, real-time control over an emitter's most common properties. It's designed for rapid iteration and fine-tuning, allowing you to see the impact of your changes instantly without digging through menus.

Any change made in the Sliders Panel is reflected **instantly** in the 3D viewport. This "Live Sync" feature is the core of the panel, enabling a fluid and intuitive workflow where you can adjust properties while the effect is playing.

<Callout type="tip" title="Customizing the Sliders Panel">
  You can customize this panel to fit your needs! Right-click any property in the main Emitter Panel and select **"Add to Sliders Panel"** to create a custom slider for quick access. This is perfect for properties you find yourself adjusting frequently.

By default, the Sliders Panel includes a set of the most frequently used emitter properties.

<PropertyReference>
    <Property name="Rate" type="number" defaultValue="10">
        Controls the number of particles emitted per second. Increasing this value creates a denser effect.
    </Property>
    <Property name="Lifetime" type="number" defaultValue="2.0">
        Determines how long each individual particle exists, in seconds. This property can also be a range (e.g., `1.5, 2.5`) to add variation.
    </Property>
    <Property name="Speed" type="number" defaultValue="5.0">
        Sets the initial velocity of emitted particles. Higher values will project particles further and faster from the emitter source.
    </Property>
    <Property name="SpreadAngle" type="Vector3" defaultValue="45, 45, 0">
        Defines the emission cone in degrees on the X and Y axes. A value of `360, 360, 0` creates a spherical emission pattern.
    </Property>
    <Property name="GlobalScale" type="number" defaultValue="1.0">
        A master scale multiplier that affects all size-related properties of the effect, including particle size, emitter shape, and tween paths. Useful for quickly resizing an entire effect.
    </Property>
