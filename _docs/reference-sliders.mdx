The Sliders Panel is your tool for rapid iteration. It provides quick, real-time control over an emitter's most common properties, allowing you to see the impact of your changes instantly in the Roblox Studio viewport without digging through menus.

### The Power of Live Sync

The core feature of this panel is "Live Sync." Any change you make here—dragging a slider, inputting a number—is reflected **immediately** on the active effect in your 3D view. This creates a fluid and intuitive workflow where you can perfect the timing, scale, and feel of an effect while it's playing.

<Callout type="tip" title="Customize Your Workspace">
  You can add any property to this panel for quick access. Right-click a property in the main Emitter Panel and select **"Add to Sliders Panel"**. This is perfect for properties you find yourself adjusting frequently for a specific effect.

### Default Properties

By default, the Sliders Panel includes a set of the most frequently used emitter properties.

<PropertyReference>
    <Property name="Rate" type="number" defaultValue="10">
        Controls the number of particles emitted per second. A higher value creates a denser, more intense effect.
    </Property>
    <Property name="Lifetime" type="number" defaultValue="2.0">
        Determines how long each individual particle exists, in seconds. This can be a single number or a range (e.g., `1.5, 2.5`) to add natural variation.
    </Property>
    <Property name="Speed" type="number" defaultValue="5.0">
        Sets the initial velocity of emitted particles. Higher values project particles further and faster from the emitter source.
    </Property>
    <Property name="SpreadAngle" type="Vector3" defaultValue="45, 45, 0">
        Defines the emission cone in degrees on the X and Y axes. A value of `0, 0, 0` creates a straight line, while `360, 360, 0` creates a full spherical emission.
    </Property>
    <Property name="GlobalScale" type="number" defaultValue="1.0">
        A master scale multiplier that affects all size-related properties of the effect, including particle size, emitter shape, and movement paths. This is extremely useful for quickly resizing an entire effect.
    </Property>
