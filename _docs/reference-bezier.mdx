The Curve Editor is your go-to tool for creating fluid, natural-looking animations. Instead of static values, you can make properties like `Size`, `Transparency`, and `Color` change dynamically over the lifetime of an effect.

It uses Bezier curves, which allow you to define a smooth path between two points using control handles. This gives you precise control over acceleration and deceleration, making your animations feel polished and professional.

- **Control Points:** These are the main points on the graph that define the value of a property at a specific time. You can add a new point by `Ctrl+Clicking` on the graph canvas.
- **Tangents:** Each control point has two tangent handles that control the shape of the curve entering and leaving the point. Dragging these handles changes the easing of the animation.
- **Time & Value:** The horizontal axis (X) represents the normalized lifetime of the effect (from 0 to 1), and the vertical axis (Y) represents the property's value.

    ```lua
    -- Curves can also be defined and applied at runtime.
    local vfx = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.VFX)
    local myEffect = vfx.GetEffect("MyCustomEffect")

    -- Create a new curve that quickly fades in, then slowly fades out.
    local customAlphaCurve = vfx.Curve.new({
      { time = 0, value = 0 },
      { time = 0.2, value = 1, tangentIn = {0.1, 0.7}, tangentOut = {0.3, 1.0} },
      { time = 1, value = 0 }
    })

    myEffect:Emit({
      Properties = {
        Transparency = customAlphaCurve
      }
    })
    ```

  <Tab title="Visual Editor Tips">
    - **Add Point:** `Ctrl + Click` anywhere on the graph.
    - **Delete Point:** Select a point and press `Delete`.
    - **Break Tangents:** Hold `Alt` while dragging a tangent handle to move it independently from the other.
    - **Snap to Grid:** Hold `Shift` while dragging a point or tangent to snap it to the grid for precise values.

<PropertyReference>
  <Property name="Tension" type="number" defaultValue="0.5">
    Controls the overall 'tightness' of the curve around its control points. Higher values create a more pronounced curve, while lower values result in a gentler slope.
  </Property>
  <Property name="Fidelity" type="string" defaultValue="Automatic">
    Determines how many segments are used to approximate the curve in the final effect. `High` is smoother for complex curves, `Low` is more performant for simple ones, and `Automatic` decides based on curve complexity.
  </Property>
  <Property name="LoopingMode" type="string" defaultValue="Once">
    Defines the behavior when the animation timeline ends.
    - `Once`: The animation plays a single time.
    - `Loop`: The animation restarts from the beginning.
    - `PingPong`: The animation plays forwards, then backwards, then forwards again.
  </Property>
