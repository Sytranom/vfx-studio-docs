The features and properties described below are for demonstration purposes and have been generated by AI. The Curve Editor is your go-to tool for creating fluid, natural-looking animations. Instead of static values, you can make properties like Size, Transparency, and Color change dynamically over the lifetime of an effect. It uses Bezier curves, which allow you to define a smooth path between two points using control handles. This gives you precise control over acceleration and deceleration, making your animations feel polished and professional.","type":"Page"},{"id":11,"url":"/docs/reference-bezier#core-concepts","title":"Core Concepts","breadcrumbs":"Curve Editor > Core Concepts","content":"The editor is built around a few key ideas.

This can be a single number or a range (e.g., 1.5, 2.5) to add natural variation. Sets the initial velocity of emitted particles. Higher values project particles further and faster from the emitter source. Defines the emission cone in degrees on the X and Y axes. A value of 0, 0, 0 creates a straight line, while 360, 360, 0 creates a full spherical emission.
